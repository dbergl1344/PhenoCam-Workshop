# Purpose

This interactive part of the workshop will walk us through interacting with the PhenoCam Server using the phenocamapi and phenocamr R packages.

You will how to extract PhenoCam data and about the post-processing of PhenoCam data. This code was adapted from code by Bijan Seyednasrollah and Koen Hufkens.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will start by introducing essential skills and tools for extracting PhenoCam data directly from the server. The objectives of this section of the workshop are to:

-   Examine PhenoCam metadata

-   Download PhenoCam time-series data

-   Download midday images for a specified time range

-   Extract and plot phenophases from a selected site

-   Link Flux data to PhenoCam data

## Exploring PhenoCam metadata

Each PhenoCam site includes specific metadata, such as the site setup, location, vegetation type, and climate regime.

Each PhenoCam site may have one or more Regions of Interest (ROIs) for each vegetation type. These will have different ROI IDs (i.e. 1000, 2000, 3000). The packages we will use today allow us to interact with the PhenoCam server to extract data and process it within an R environment.

```{r libraries}
library(data.table)
library(phenocamapi)
library(lubridate)
library(jpeg)
library(phenocamr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(gridExtra)
```

We can retrieve an up-to-date data.frame containing metadata for the entire PhenoCam network using the get_phenos() function. This will The returned value will be a data.table to facilitate further data
exploration. This function connect directly to the PhenoCam API to retrieve the latest metadata for all sites of the PhenoCam network.

```{r obtain-data, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, message=FALSE}
# Fetch the latest metadata for PhenoCam sites, returned as a data.table for easy manipulation
phenosCurrent <- get_phenos()

# Preview the first six rows of the site column to inspect the initial PhenoCam sites in the network
head(phenosCurrent$site)

# Display all column names to see the full range of metadata available for each PhenoCam site
colnames(phenosCurrent)
```

Now we have a better idea of the types of metadata that are available for the Phenocams.

### Remove null values

Before focusing on specific locations, we may want to examine some patterns in the metadata. Let's explore Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) across the various field sites, grouping them by the primary vegetation type (primary_veg_type) at each site. To proceed, we first need to identify the abbreviations used by the upcoming functions, as shown in the table below.

| Abbreviation |                     Description                     |     |
|--------------|:---------------------------------------------------:|----:|
| AG           |                     agriculture                     |     |
| DB           |                 deciduous broadleaf                 |     |
| DN           |                deciduous needleleaf                 |     |
| EB           |                 evergreen broadleaf                 |     |
| EN           |                evergreen needleleaf                 |     |
| GR           |                      grassland                      |     |
| MX           | mixed vegetation (generally EN/DN, DB/EN, or DB/EB) |     |
| SH           |                       shrubs                        |     |
| TN           |   tundra (includes sedges, lichens, mosses, etc.)   |     |
| WT           |                       wetland                       |     |
| NV           |                    non-vegetated                    |     |
| RF           |                   reference panel                   |     |
| XX           |                     unspecified                     |     |

First, we want to remove the sites where there is not MAP and MAT as part of the metadata, and then plot the data.

```{r plot-MAT-MAP, message=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
# #Some sites do not have data on Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Temperature (MAT).
# Remove sites with NA MAT and MAP values
phenosCurrent <- phenosCurrent[!((MAT_worldclim == -9999) | (MAP_worldclim == -9999))]

# Create a ggplot scatter plot with differentbased on vegetation type
ggplot(phenosCurrent, aes(x = MAT_worldclim, y = MAP_worldclim, color = primary_veg_type, shape = primary_veg_type)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('DB' = '#1f77b4',    # Blue
                                'DN' = '#ff7f0e',    # Orange
                                'EN' = '#2ca02c',    # Green
                                'EB' = '#d62728',    # Red
                                'AG' = '#9467bd',    # Purple
                                'SH' = '#e377c2')) + # Pink
  scale_shape_manual(values = c('DB' = 19, 'DN' = 1, 'EN' = 17, 'EB' = 25, 'AG' = 12, 'SH' = 23)) +
  labs(title = "PhenoCam Sites by Vegetation Type in Climate Space", 
       x = "Mean Annual Temperature (Â°C)", 
       y = "Mean Annual Precipitation (mm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  xlim(-5, 27) +
  ylim(0, 4000)


```

## PhenoCam time series

PhenoCam time series consist of data extracted from Regions of Interest (ROIs) at a specific site. The first step is to obtain the ROIs.

### Obtain ROIs

To download the phenological time series from PhenoCam, we need the site name, vegetation type, and ROI ID. This information can be retrieved from each PhenoCam site using the get_rois() function from the
phenocamapi package.

```{r get-rois, fig.height=5, fig.width=6.5, message=FALSE}
# Obtaining the list of all the available regions of interest (ROI's) on the PhenoCam server and producing a data table
# rois <- get_rois()
PhenoCamROIs <- rois

# view the data variables in the data table
colnames(PhenoCamROIs)

# view first few regions of of interest (ROI) locations
head(PhenoCamROIs$roi_name)
```

### Download time series

Now that we have our ROI data frame, we can use the `get_pheno_ts()` function to download a time series of our site within that region of interest and return the result as a `data.table`. We will work with the
Kemp Natural Resources Station in Wisconsin ('kempnrs') and the ROI == 1000. The primary vegetation type here is deciduous broadleaf with a secondary vegetation type of evergreen needleleaf.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=6.5, message=FALSE}
# list ROIs for kempnrs
PhenoCamROIs[site=='kempnrs',]

# Obtain the deciduous broadleaf, ROI ID 1000 data from the dukehw phenocam
kempnrs_DB_1000 <- get_pheno_ts(site = 'kempnrs', vegType = 'DB', roiID = 1000, type = '3day')

# Produces a list of the kempnrs data variables
str(kempnrs_DB_1000)
```

We now have various data related to this ROI from the deciduous stand at Kemp Natural Resources Station in Wisconsin. One of these is the green chromatic coordinate (GCC), which measures the "greenness" of an area
and serves as an indicator of the green pigment in vegetation.

We can use this data to track changes in GCC, or greenness, over time at this site. We will use gcc90, the 90th percentile GCC value, calculated over a 3-day moving window for the ROI. This metric captures the upper
range of greenness values while minimizing the influence of outliers.

Before plotting gcc90, we need to adjust the dates, converting them from Factors to Date format to ensure accurate plotting.

```{r plot-gcc90, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
# Convert date variable into date format if not already done
kempnrs_DB_1000[, date := as.Date(date)]

# Create a ggplot plot for gcc_90 with improved aesthetics
ggplot(kempnrs_DB_1000, aes(x = date, y = gcc_90)) +
  geom_line(color = '#2C7F2E', size = 1.2) +    # Green line with thicker width
  geom_point(color = '#2C7F2E', size = 2) +    # Green points
  labs(title = 'Kemp Natural Resources Station, Deciduous Stand',
       subtitle = 'Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) Over Time',
       x = 'Date',
       y = 'GCC 90th Percentile') +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +               # Clean and minimal theme
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),  # Bold title
        plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic"))  # Italic subtitle
```

### Download midday images for a given time range

Now, let's say we want to "peek" into our forest. To do this, we can access the midday images and download them individually. However, it is often more useful to download all images within a specific time range and a given day of a month. This can be done using the phenocamapi package.

```{r midday-time-range, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# open a temporary directory
temp_directory <- tempdir()

# download a subset. Example kempnrs 2022
download_midday_images(site = 'kempnrs', # which site
                       y = 2022, # which year(s)
                       months = 1:12, # which month(s)
                       days = 15, # which days on month(s)
                       download_dir = temp_directory) # where on your computer

# list of downloaded files
kempnrs_Path <- dir(temp_directory, pattern = 'kempnrs*', full.names = TRUE)

# Remove only .jpg files from the directory
#file.remove(list.files("/var/folders/ff/rhm4ty2570zfn9dpvd74mcyr0000gn/T//RtmpDYJ698", pattern = "\\.jpg$",  full.names = TRUE))

```

And with these images, we can demonstrate the seasonality of the Kemp
Natural Resources Station in Wisconsin observed from the camera. (Note
this code may take a while to run through the loop).

```{r plot-monthly-forest, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
n <- length(kempnrs_Path)
par(mar= c(0,0,0,0), mfrow=c(4,3), oma=c(0,0,3,0))

for(i in 1:n){
  img <- readJPEG(kempnrs_Path[i])
  plot(0:1,0:1, type='n', axes= FALSE, xlab= '', ylab = '')
  rasterImage(img, 0, 0, 1, 1)
  mtext(month.name[i], line = -2)
}
mtext('Seasonal variation at the Kemp Natural Resources Station in Wisconsin ', font = 2, outer = TRUE)
```

# Connecting Flux Data to PhenoCam Data

Alternatively, we may want to include only PhenoCam sites with specific attributes in our datasets. For instance, if we are interested in sites that also have available flux data, we can filter the metadata using the `flux_sitenames` attribute to select those sites.

```{r filter-flux, fig.height=5, fig.width=6.5, message=FALSE}
# Create a data table only including the sites that have flux_data available and where the FLUX site name is specified
phenofluxsites <- phenos[flux_data==TRUE&!is.na(flux_sitenames)&flux_sitenames!='',.(PhenoCam=site, Flux=flux_sitenames)] # return as table

#Specify to retain variables of Phenocam site and their flux tower name
phenofluxsites <- phenofluxsites[Flux!='']

# view the first few rows of the data table
head(phenofluxsites)

```

What if we're interested in PhenoCam and Flux data co-located within a specific vegetation type? We can do this by filtering for PhenoCam sites with a flux tower located in deciduous broadleaf forests
(`primary_veg_type == 'DB'`).

```{r filter-flux-db, fig.height=5, fig.width=6.5, message=FALSE}

#list deciduous broadleaf sites with a flux tower
PhenoFlux.DB <- phenos[flux_data==TRUE&primary_veg_type=='DB', 
                  site]  # return just the site names as a list

# see the first few rows
head(PhenoFlux.DB)
```

# Looking at PhenoCam and Flux Data Together

Here we will merge PhenoCam and Flux data from the Bartlett Experimental Forest. This site has both PhenoCam data and eddy covariance (EC) flux tower data. We will focus on the year 2018. If you want to repeat this,
you will need to have already processed or downloaded Flux data, which can be done using packages like amerifluxR. We will download the PhenoCam time series data for the Bartlett site, filter it for 2018, and
then merge it with the flux data. 

After merging, we will look at the seasonal patterns by plotting the 90th percentile Green Chromatic
Coordinate (GCC) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) over time, followed by an interactive scatter plot to investigate the relationship
between GCC and GPP.

```{r}
# Here we will have already needed to download Flux data that you process or that is already proccessed. You can use packages like amerifluxR to do this. Here we are going to work with the Bartlett site that has both PhenoCam data colacated with a EC flux tower. We will focus on the year 2018. 
# Merge the datasets by site and date
head(Bart_2018)

# Download PhenoCam time series for the Bartlett site in 2018
bartlett_pheno_2018 <- get_pheno_ts(site = 'bartlettir', vegType = 'DB', roiID = 2000, type = '3day')

# Convert date to proper format
bartlett_pheno_2018[, date := as.Date(date)]

# Filter PhenoCam data for the year 2018
bartlett_pheno_2018_2018 <- bartlett_pheno_2018[year(date) == 2018]

# View the first few rows of the PhenoCam data
head(bartlett_pheno_2018_2018)

# Add a date column to the Bartlett flux data (by extracting just the date part from DateTime)
Bart_2018$date <- as.Date(Bart_2018$DateTime)

# Merge the PhenoCam data with the Bartlett flux data by date
merged_fluxPhenodata <- merge(bartlett_pheno_2018_2018, Bart_2018, by = "date")

# View the first few rows of the merged data
head(merged_fluxPhenodata)

# Create a new column for Day of Year (DOY) to explore seasonality
merged_fluxPhenodata$doy <- yday(merged_fluxPhenodata$date)

# Replace negative GPP values with 0
merged_fluxPhenodata <- merged_fluxPhenodata %>%
  mutate(GPPU50 = ifelse(GPPU50 < 0, 0, GPPU50))

# Plot 1: GCC across the year (DOY)
plot_gcc <- ggplot(merged_fluxPhenodata, aes(x = doy)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = gcc_90), color = "green") +
  labs(title = "Seasonal Patterns: GCC", x = "Day of Year (DOY)", y = "GCC 90th Percentile") +

# Phenology Transition Dates

Above we used midday images to visualize an entire growing season using PhenoCam imagery. But now what if we want to see if this growing season has been changing over time? Or track whether the start of season, end
of season, or greenness has changed through time?

We can use the phenocamr package to visualize this. The phenphases() function in the phenocamr package will extract the start of spring and end of fall dates. First, let's download the BERMS Southern Old Black Spruce Site data in Prince Albert National Park using this package.

```{r}
 download_phenocam(site = "canadaOBS",
                    veg_type = "DN",
                    roi_id = "1000",
                    frequency = 3,
                    outlier_detection = FALSE,
                    smooth = FALSE,
                    out_dir = tempdir())

#Now we need to assign a dataframe to the data that we just downloaded
dfCanadaOBS <- read_phenocam(file.path(tempdir(),"canadaOBS_DN_1000_3day.csv"))
```

# Detecting Outliers and Smoothing the Time Series

Now that we have our dataframe, we will want to detect any outliers in our data and smooth the time series.

```{r}
  dfCanadaOBS <- detect_outliers(dfCanadaOBS)
  dfCanadaOBS <- smooth_ts(dfCanadaOBS)
```

# Calculating the Phenophases

Now that the smoothed data has been made available, we can calculate and plot the phenological transition dates.

```{r}
# Convert dates to Date format 
dfCanadaOBS$data$date <- as.Date(dfCanadaOBS$data$date)

dfCanadaOBSphenology_dates <- phenophases(dfCanadaOBS, internal = TRUE)

# Create plot with GCC values and approachable colors
ggplot(dfCanadaOBS$data, aes(x = date, y = smooth_gcc_90)) +
  geom_line(color = "black", size = 1) +             # black for the GCC line
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(dfCanadaOBSphenology_dates$rising$transition_50),
             color = "forestgreen", linetype = "dashed", size = 1.2) +  # Green for spring greenup
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(dfCanadaOBSphenology_dates$falling$transition_50),
             color = "chocolate4", linetype = "dashed", size = 1.2) +  # brown for autumn senescence
  labs(title = "GCC and Phenophase Transitions for BERMS",
       x = "Date",
       y = "GCC 90th Percentile") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

```

# Linking Flux Data and Phenophases 
Here we use the phenophases() function to calculate the phenophase transition dates at the Bartlett Experimental Forest to connect those phases to the flux data, namely GPP.

We can plot GPP over time and added vertical lines marking the phenophase transitions, including the 10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles of both spring and autumn phenophases. This will show us how changes in GPP correspond to critical periods of vegetation development and senescence. This combined approach can illustrate the temporal dynamics of vegetation phenology and ecosystem function at Bartlett during the year 2018.

```{r}
Bart <- download_phenocam(site = "bartlettir", veg_type = "DB", roi_id = "2000", frequency = 3, out_dir = tempdir())

dfBart <- read_phenocam(file.path(tempdir(), "bartlettir_DB_2000_3day.csv"))

# Detect outliers and smooth the time series
dfBart <- detect_outliers(dfBart)
dfBart <- smooth_ts(dfBart)

# Calculate phenophases for the Bartlett data
phenology_datesBart <- phenophases(dfBart, internal = TRUE)
dfBart <- as.Date(dfBart$data$date)
# View phenology transition dates
phenology_datesBart$rising
phenology_datesBart$falling

# Add vertical lines for rising and falling phenophase transitions from dfBart
remove_close_dates <- function(dates, threshold = 5) {

    if (length(dates) <= 1) return(dates)
    filtered_dates <- dates[1]
    for (i in 2:length(dates)) {
        if (abs(as.numeric(dates[i] - filtered_dates[length(filtered_dates)])) > threshold) {
            filtered_dates <- c(filtered_dates, dates[i])
        }
    }
    return(filtered_dates)
