This tutorial focuses on aggregating and combining various climate and phenology 
data sources for modeling purposes using the *phenor* R package. This tutorial 
explains the various data sources and in particular phenocam data, the structure 
of the formatted data and the final modelling procedures using various phenology 
models.

<div id="ds-objectives" markdown="1"> 

**R Skill Level:** Introduction - you've got the basics of `R` down and 
understand the general structure of tabular data and lists.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able:

* to download PhenoCam time series data
* to process time series data into transition date products (phenological events)
* to download colocated climate
* to format these data in a standardized scheme
* to use formatted data to calibrate phenology models
* to make phenology predictions using forecast climate data

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial

You will need the most current version of R and RStudio loaded on your computer 
to complete this tutorial. Optionally, a login to the 
<a href="http://www.pep725.eu/" target="_blank">Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725)</a> 
website can be used for data retrieval.

### Install R Packages

These R packages will be used in the tutorial below. Please make sure they are 
installed prior to starting the tutorial.
 
* **devtools** `install.packages("devtools")`
* **phenor:** `install_github("khufkens/phenor")`
* **phenocamr:** `install.packages("phenocamr")`
* **maps:** `install.packages("maps")`

</div>

This tutorial has three parts:

1. Introductions to the relevant R packages
2. Aggregating & format the data
3. Model phenology

Due to the the large size of the data involved, we will learn how to obtain research
quality data in the aggregating data steps but we will use pre-subsetted data sets
for the modeling. The pre-subsetted sets can be downloaded at the end of each 
section or directly accessed during the modeling section. 

## The R packages

### phenor

The *phenor* R package is a phenology modeling framework in R. The framework 
leverages measurements of vegetation phenology from four common phenology 
observation datasets combined with (global) retrospective and projected climate 
data. Currently, the package focuses on North America and Europe and relies 
heavily on 
<a href="https://daymet.ornl.gov/" target="_blank">Daymet</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.ecad.eu/download/ensembles/download.php" target="_blank">E-OBS climate data</a> 
for underlying climate driver data in model optimization. The package supports 
global gridded CMIP5 forecasts for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios
using the 
<a href="https://nex.nasa.gov/nex/projects/1356/" target="_blank">NASA Earth Exchange global downscaled daily projections</a>.

Phenological model calibration and validation data are derived from four main sources:

- the transition dates derived from <a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu" target="_blank">PhenoCam</a> time series and included in this package. 
- the MODIS MCD12Q2 phenology product using the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1273/full" target="_blank">MODISTools R package</a>
- the <a href="http://www.pep725.eu/" target="_blank">Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725)</a> 
- the <a href="https://www.usanpn.org/" target="_blank">USA National Phenological Network (USA-NPN)</a>. 

### phenocamr

We will also use the the *phenocamr* package in the processing of data provided 
through the PhenoCam API and past data releases. Although the uses of standard product 
releases is encouraged in some instances you might want more control over the 
data processing and the transition date products generated. *phenocamr* provides 
this flexibility.

## Get PhenoCam Data

In this tutorial, you are going to download PhenoCam time series, extract 
transition dates and combine the derived spring phenology data, Daymet data, to
calibrate a spring phenology model. Finally, you make projections for the end 
of the century under an RCP8.5 CMIP5 model scenario.

The PhenoCam Network includes data from around the globe 
(<a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/network/map/" target="_blank">map</a>.) 
However, there are other data sources that may be of interest including the Pan 
European Phenology Project (PEP725). For more on accessing data from the PEP725, 
please see the final section of this tutorial. 

First, we need to set up our R environment. 

```{r install-packages, message = FALSE}
# uncomment for install
# install.packages("devtools")
# install_github("khufkens/phenor")
# install.packages("phenocamr")
# install.packages("maps")
install_github("khufkens/phenor")
library("phenocamr")
library("phenor")
library("maps")
library("raster")
```

To download phenology data from the PhenoCam network use the `download_phenocam()`
function from the *phenocamr* package. This function allows you to download site
based data and process it according to a standardized methodology. A full description of the methodology is provided in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201828" target="_blank">Scientific
Data: Tracking vegetation phenology across diverse North American biomes using PhenoCam imagery (Richardson et al. 2018)</a>.

The code below downloads all time series for deciduous broadleaf data at the 
<a href="https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/sites/bartlettir/" target="_blank">Bartlett Experimental Forest (`bartlettir`) PhenoCam site</a> 
and estimate the phenophases (spring & autumn). For a detailed description of 
the download procedure consult the 
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phenocamr/index.html" target="_blank">phenocamr R package documentation</a>.

```{r download-data}
# download the three day time series for deciduous broadleaf data at the 
# Bartlett site and will estimate the phenophases (spring + autumn). 

phenocamr::download_phenocam(
  frequency = 3,
  veg_type = "DB",
  roi_id = 1000,
  site = "bartlettir",
  phenophase = TRUE,
  out_dir = "."
  )

```

Using the code (`out_dir = "."`) causes the downloaded data, both the 3-day time
series and the calculated transition dates, to be stored in your current working 
directory. You can change that is you want to save it elsewhere. You will get feedback on the processing steps completed.

We can now load this data; both the time series and the transition files.

```{r read-data }
# load the time series data
df <- read.table("bartlettir_DB_1000_3day.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# read in the transition date file
td <- read.table("bartlettir_DB_1000_3day_transition_dates.csv",
                 header = TRUE,
                 sep = ",")

```

### Threshold values 

Now let's plot the data to see what we are working with. But first, let's 
subset the transition date (`td`) for each year when 25% of the greenness amplitude (of the 90^th^) percentile is reached (`threshold_25`).

```{r plot-data }
# select the rising (spring dates) for 25% threshold of Gcc 90
td <- td[td$direction == "rising" & td$gcc_value == "gcc_90",]

# create a simple line graph of the smooth Green Chromatic Coordinate (Gcc)
# and add points for transition dates
plot(as.Date(df$date), df$smooth_gcc_90, type = "l", xlab = "Date",
     ylab = "Gcc (90th percentile)")
points(x = as.Date(td$transition_25, origin = "1970-01-01"),
       y = td$threshold_25,
       pch = 19,
       col = "red")

```

Now we can se the transition date for each year of interest and the annual 
patterns of the Gcc. 

However, if you want more control over the parameters used during processing, 
you can run through the three default processing steps as implemented in 
`download_phenocam()` and set parameters manually. 

Of particular interest is the option to specify your own threshold used in 
determining transition dates. In the example below, we will set the upper 
threshold value to 80% of the amplitude (or 0.8). We will visualize the data as 
above, showing the newly found transition dates along the Gcc curve.

```{r manual-thresholds}
# the first step in phenocam processing is flagging of the outliers
# on the file you visualized in the previous step
detect_outliers("bartlettir_DB_1000_3day.csv",
                out_dir = ".")

# the second step involves smoothing the data using an optimization approach
# we force the procedure as it will be skipped if smoothed data is already
# available
smooth_ts("bartlettir_DB_1000_3day.csv",
          out_dir = ".",
          force = TRUE)

# the third and final step is the generation of phenological transition dates
td <- phenophases("bartlettir_DB_1000_3day.csv",
            internal = TRUE,
            upper_thresh = 0.8)
```

Now we have manually set the parameters that were default for our first plot.
Note, that here is also a lower and a middle threshold parameter, the order matters so
always use the relevant parameter (for parameters, check transition_dates())

Now we can again plot the annual pattern with the transition dates. 

```{r plot-manual-thresholds }
# split out the rising (spring) component for Gcc 90th
td <- td$rising[td$rising$gcc_value == "gcc_90",]

# we can now visualize the upper threshold
plot(as.Date(df$date), df$smooth_gcc_90, type = "l",
     xlab = "Date",
     ylab = "Gcc (90th percentile)")
points(x = as.Date(td$transition_80, origin = "1970-01-01"),
       y = td$threshold_80,
       pch = 19,
       col = "red")
```

With the above examples you can get a feeling of how to manually re-process
PhenoCam time series. 

### Phenocam Subsetted Data Set

To allow our models to run in a timely manner, we will use the subsetted data 
that is included with the *phenor* packages for the modeling portion of this 
tutorial. All deciduous broadleaf forest data in the PhenoCam V1.0 have been processed 
using the above settings. This data set is called `phenocam_DB`. 

Alternatively, you can download a curated dataset from the ORNL DAAC, as fully described in 
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201828" target="_blank">Scientific
Data: Tracking vegetation phenology across diverse North American biomes using PhenoCam imagery (Richardson et al. 2018)</a>. 
A limited copy, including only time series and transition dates, is also mirrored
as a 
<a href="https://github.com/khufkens/phenocam_dataset" target="_blank">github repo (500 mb)</a>. 

## Get Climate Data

In order to calibrate phenology models, additional climate data is required. 
Some of this data is dynamically queried during the formatting of the data. 
Alternatively, we can get climate data from another source, like the 
<a href="https://cmip.llnl.gov/cmip5/" target="_blank">Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)</a>.
The forecast CMIP5 data is gridded data which is too large to process dynamically. 
In order to use the CMIP5 data to make phenology projections the data needs to 
be downloaded one year at a time, and subset where possible to reduce file sizes. 
Below you find the instructions to download the 2090 CMIP5 data for the RCP8.5 
scenario of the MIROC5 model. The data will be stored in the R temporary 
directory for later use. Please note that this is a large file (> 4 GB). 

```{r CMIP-data, eval = FALSE}
# download source cmip5 data into your temporary directory
# please note this is a large download: >4GB! 
phenor::pr_dl_cmip(
  year = 2090,
  path = tempdir(),
  model = "MIROC5",
  scenario = "rcp85"
  )

phenor::pr_dl_cmip(
  year = 2010,
  path = tempdir(),
  model = "MIROC5",
  scenario = "rcp85"
  )

```

## Format Phenology & Climate Data

If both phenology and climate data are available you can aggregate and format 
the data for modeling purposes. All functions in the *phenor* package with a 
`format_` prefix serve this purpose, although some might lack phenology 
validation data.

You can format phenocam data using the `format_phenocam()` function, which 
requires you to provide the correct path to phenocam transition date files, like 
those we downloaded above). This function will match the transition dates from 
PhenoCam data with the appropriate Daymet data (dynamically).

In the next code chunk, we will format the phenocam transition date data 
(in your working directory, ".") correctly. Then we will specify the direction of the curve to be considered and setting the Gcc percentile, threshold and temporal offset. 

```{r format-data, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# Format the phenocam transition date data 
# Specify the direction of the curve 
# Specify the gcc percentile, threshold and the temporal offset

phenocam_data <- phenor::format_phenocam(
  path = ".",
  direction = "rising",
  gcc_value = "gcc_90",
  threshold = 50,
  offset = 264,
  internal = TRUE
  )
# When internal = TRUE, the data will be returned to the R
# workspace, otherwise the data will be saved to disk.

# view data structure
str(phenocam_data)

```

As you can see, this formats a nested list of data. This nested list is consistent
across all `format_` functions.

Finally, when making projections for the coming century you can use the 
`format_cmip5()` function. This function does not rely on phenology data but 
creates a consistent data structure so models can easily use this data. 
In addition, there is the option to constrain the data, which is global, 
spatially with an `extent` parameter. The extent is a vector with coordinates 
defining the region of interest defined as xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax in latitude and 
longitude.

This code has a large download size, we do not show the output of this code.

```{r format-cmip, eval = FALSE}
# format the cmip5 data
cmip5_2090 <- phenor::format_cmip5(
  path = tempdir(), 
  year = 2090,
  offset = 264,
  model = "MIROC5",
  scenario = "rcp85",
  extent = c(-95, -65, 24, 50),
  internal = FALSE
  )

cmip5_2010 <- phenor::format_cmip5(
  path = tempdir(), 
  year = 2010,
  offset = 264,
  model = "MIROC5",
  scenario = "rcp85",
  extent = c(-95, -65, 24, 50),
  internal = FALSE
  )

```


### Climate Training Dataset
Given the large size of the climate projection data above, we will use subsetted 
and formatted training dataset. In that section of the tutorial, we will directly 
read the data into R.

Alternatively, you can download it here 
<a href="https://github.com/khufkens/phenocamr_phenor_demo/archive/master.zip" target="_blank">as a zip file (128 MB)</a>
 or obtain the data by cloning the GitHub repository, 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khufkens/phenocamr_phenor_demo.git

```

Now that we have the needed phenology and climate projection data, we can create our model.

## Phenology Model Parameterization

Gathering all this data serves as input to a model calibration routine. This 
routine tweaks parameters in the model specification in order to best fit the 
response to the available phenology data using the colocated climate driver data.

The default optimization method uses Simulated Annealing to find optimal 
parameter sets. Ideally the routine is run for >10K iterations (longer for 
complex models). When the procedure ends, by default, a plot of the modeled ~ measured data 
is provided in addition to model fit statistics. This gives you quick feedback 
on model accuracy.

For a full list of all models included and their model structure, please refer 
to the <a href="https://github.com/khufkens/phenor" target="_blank">package documentation</a> and 
<a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12970" target="_blank"> Hufkens et al. 2018. An integrated phenology modelling framework in R: Phenology modelling with phenor</a>.

For the phenology data, we'll used the example data that comes with *phenor*. This
will allow our models to run faster than if we used all the data we downloaded
in the second part of this tutorial. `phencam_DB` includes a subset of the 
deciduous broadleaf forest data in the PhenoCam V1.0. This has all been 
processed using the settings we used above. 

```{r model-param, eval = TRUE}
# load example data
data("phenocam_DB")

# Calibrate a simple Thermal Time (TT) model using simulated annealing
# for both the phenocam and PEP725 data. This routine might take some
# time to execute.
phenocam_par <- model_calibration(
  model = "TT",
  data = phenocam_DB,
  method = "GenSA",
  control = list(max.call = 4000),
  par_ranges = sprintf("%s/extdata/parameter_ranges.csv", path.package("phenor")),
  plot = TRUE)

# you can specify or alter the parameter ranges as located in
# copy this file and use the par_ranges parameter to use your custom version
print(sprintf("%s/extdata/parameter_ranges.csv", path.package("phenor")))

```

We can list the parameters by looking at one of the nested list items (`par`).

```{r view-par, eval = TRUE}
# only list the TT model parameters, ignore other
# ancillary fields
print(phenocam_par$par)
```

## Phenology Model Predictions

To finally evaluate how these results would change phenology by the end of the 
century we use the formatted CMIP5 data to `estimate_phenology()` with those 
given drivers.

We will use demo CMIP5 data, instead of the data we downloaded earlier, so that 
our model comes processes faster. 

```{r get-cmip-data, eval = TRUE}
# download the cmip5 files from the demo repository
download.file("https://github.com/khufkens/phenocamr_phenor_demo/raw/master/data/phenor_cmip5_data_MIROC5_2090_rcp85.rds",
              "phenor_cmip5_data_MIROC5_2090_rcp85.rds")

download.file("https://github.com/khufkens/phenocamr_phenor_demo/raw/master/data/phenor_cmip5_data_MIROC5_2010_rcp85.rds",
              "phenor_cmip5_data_MIROC5_2010_rcp85.rds")

# read in cmip5 data
cmip5_2090 <- readRDS("phenor_cmip5_data_MIROC5_2090_rcp85.rds")
cmip5_2010 <- readRDS("phenor_cmip5_data_MIROC5_2010_rcp85.rds")
```

Now that we have both the phenocam data and the climate date we want run our 
model projection. 

```{r model, eval = TRUE }
# project results forward to 2090 using the phenocam parameters
cmip5_projection_2090 <- phenor::estimate_phenology(
  par = phenocam_par$par, # provide parameters
  data = cmip5_2090, # provide data
  model = "TT" # make sure to use the same model !
)

# project results forward to 2010 using the phenocam parameters
cmip5_projection_2010 <- phenor::estimate_phenology(
  par = phenocam_par$par, # provide parameters
  data = cmip5_2010, # provide data
  model = "TT" # make sure to use the same model !
)
```

If data are gridded data, the output will automatically be formatted as raster 
data, which can be plotted using the *raster* package as a map. 

Let's view our model. 

```{r map-model, eval = TRUE}
# plot the gridded results and overlay
# a world map outline
par(oma = c(0,0,0,0))
raster::plot(cmip5_projection_2090, main = "DOY")
maps::map("world", add = TRUE)
```

Maybe more intersting is showing the difference between the start (2010) and the
end (2090) of the century.

```{r map-model-diff, eval = TRUE}
# plot the gridded results and overlay
# a world map outline for reference
par(oma = c(0,0,0,0))
raster::plot(cmip5_projection_2010 - cmip5_projection_2090,
             main = expression(Delta * "DOY"))
maps::map("world", add = TRUE)
```

What can you take away from these model visualizations?

## PEP725 data

To get phenocam data for Europe. you will likely want to use the Pan European 
Phenology Project (PEP725). This section teaching you how to access PEP725 data.

### PEP725 Log In
Downloading data from the PEP725 network using *phenor* is more elaborate as it 
requires a login 
<a href="http://www.pep725.eu/" target="_blank">on the PEP725 website</a> 
before you can access any data. 

In order to move forward with this tutorial, create a login on the PEP725 
website and save your login details in a plain text file (.txt) containing your 
email address and password on the first and second line, respectively. Name this
file appropriately (e.g., pep725_credentials.txt.)

### PEP725 Data Availability
To download PEP725 data you need to find out which data are available. You can 
either consult the data portal of the website, or use the `check_pep725_species()`
function. This function allows you to either list all species in the dataset, or 
search by (partial) matches on the species names.

```{r get-pep725-data}
# to list all species use
species_list <- phenor::check_pep725_species(list = TRUE)

# to search only for Quercus (oak) use
quercus_nr <- phenor::check_pep725_species(species = "quercus")

# return results
head(species_list)
head(quercus_nr)

```

A query for *Quercus* returns a species ID number of **111**. Once you have 
established the required species number you can move forward and download the species data.

```{r eval = FALSE}
phenor::download_pep725(
  credentials = "~/pep725_credentials.txt",
  species = 111,
  path = ".",
  internal = FALSE
  )
```

The data use policy does not allow to distribute data so this will conclude 
the tutorial portion on downloading PEP725 observational data. However, the use 
of the formatting functions required in *phenor* is consistent and the example 
using PhenoCam data, above, should make you confident in processing data 
from the PEP725 database once downloaded.

### PEP Climate Data

For the formatting of the PEP725 data, no automated routine is provided due to 
the size of the download and policy of the E-OBS dataset. Register and download the 
<a href="https://www.ecad.eu/download/ensembles/ensembles.php" target="_blank"> E-OBS data</a> 
for the 0.25 degree **regular grid** for the best estimates of TG, TN, TX, RR, 
PP (0.5 degree data is supported but not recommended).


### Format PEP Climate Data

Similarly, the PEP725 data have a dedicated formatting function in the *phenor* 
package, `format_pep725()`. However, it will use the previously downloaded E-OBS 
data to provided the required climate data for the downloaded PEP725 data 
(both file directories are requested). In addition, you need to specify which 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCH-scale" target="_blank">BBCH-scale value</a> 
you would like to see included in the final formatted dataset.

```{r format-pep-data, eval = FALSE}
# provisional query, code not run due to download / login requirements
pep725_data <- phenor::format_pep725(
  pep_path = ".",
  eobs_path = "/your/eobs/path/",
  bbch = "11",
  offset = 264,
  count = 60,
  resolution = 0.25
  )
```
